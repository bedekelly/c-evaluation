#Evaluation

**C assignment: evaluate an abstract syntax tree.**

Run `make main` for the main assessed assignment, `make test` for a more comprehensive test of let-bindings being overwritten, and `make clean` to remove extraneous files in the directory.

* The output of `make main && ./evalexp` should be "1000".

* The output of `make test && ./test` should be "1000", a newline, then "375".
